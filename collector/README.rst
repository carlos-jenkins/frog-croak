Frog Croak is composed of two separate programs:

- *Viewer*: A Javascript application that allows to display and analyse
  gathered data.
- *Collector*: A Python application that collects speed tests data samples over
  time.


This Python package holds Frog Croak data Collector only, not the viewer.
